      <div className="poem">
        <p>
          Upon a lily pad so green,<br />
          A frog sits, rarely to be seen.<br />
          He croaks his song into the night,<br />
          While fireflies dance in soft moonlight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Splash and jump from pad to pad,<br />
          The happiest life a frog has had.<br />
          In peaceful pond he makes his home,<br />
          Content to never have to roam.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ribbit, ribbit, through the day,<br />
          Catching flies that come his way.<br />
          Nature's song he helps compose,<br />
          As evening gently dims to close.
        </p>
      </div>
